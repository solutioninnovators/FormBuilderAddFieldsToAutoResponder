# FormBuilderAddFieldsToAutoResponder
Developed by Mike Spooner (thetuningspoon) for Solution Innovators

Adds a checkbox to the Actions tab in the form settings to give you the option of including the form fields with the auto-responder email. Also checks to see whether a field has a value set before outputting it in the email.

##Usage

1. Install module

2. Move the email-autoresponder.php file included with this module to /site/templates/FormBuilder/

3. Under the Actions tab under Auto-responder you should now see a checkbox to turn on and off form fields on a per-form basis.
